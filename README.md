A custom weather widget that displays the current temp, weather conditions and five day forecast for a pre-defined city.

2. **cleanslate.css** is an aggressive css reset fil used to reset the css for the widget only
3. **ww.css** includes the styles for the widget
4. **ww.js** is the script which dynamically builds the widget.
